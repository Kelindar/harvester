Harvester
=========


This utility allows performance data collection of both operating system events and hardware counters on Intel platforms. Under the hood, using Microsoft WPT technology (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh162945.aspx) and Intel Performance Counter Monitor (http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-performance-counter-monitor-a-better-way-to-measure-cpu-utilization) to collect the data. It processes and merges both datasets in order to allow hardware performance counters to be matched to individual threads.

Harvester utility has been developed at the School of Computer Science & Statistics at Trinity College Dublin as part of research conducted at The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre (LERO), supported by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).
